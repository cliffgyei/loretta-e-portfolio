                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I am Loretta Ampofo, a 25-year-old from Ghana, currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSc) program at Loyalist College, where I am in my first year at level 100.

                    Since my early years, my aspiration has always been to become a nurse. Even as a child, I received praise for my nurturing care towards my siblings when entrusted with babysitting responsibilities. I am confident, strive for excellence, and am not one to give up easily. I am ready to pursue my nursing education, firmly dedicated to realizing my dream of becoming a nurse.
                    
                    My initial months in school have been a transformative experience, instilling in me values such as respecting diverse cultures and fostering tolerance. These qualities are essential in providing compassionate and inclusive care to patients.
                    
                    Looking ahead, my long-term goal is to specialize as a pediatric nurse, actively contributing to hospitals in Canada. I am enthusiastic about making a positive impact, and my personal motto guides me: "Supporting with my utmost dedication and compassion."
                    
                    The values I hold dear, including respect, honor, and trust, align seamlessly with the qualities required to excel in the nursing profession. I believe these values make me well-suited to contribute meaningfully to the field of nursing.</p>
